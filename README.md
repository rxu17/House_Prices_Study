# House_Prices_Study

# Description:
There are 79 explanatory variables (included in a data variable description txt file)

The prediction is evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)

# Goal
The goal of the project is to predict the sales price for each house using the best variables in Python.
